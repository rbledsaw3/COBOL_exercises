             ╰─── Indicator Area

Sequence Number Area: starts with 000100 and increments by 000100 
    (000100, 000200, etc.). Can be blank.

Indicator Area: Indicates if the line is a comment, a continuation of a
    previous line, for debugging, or source code listing formatting.
    * = comment
    - = continuation
    d = debug
    / = source code listing formatting

A Area: DIVISIONS, SECTIONS, PARAGRAPHS, LEVEL INDICATORS, and other elements
    that provide structure.

B Area: Where STATEMENTS, SENTENCES, and CLAUSES go to perform logic.

Identification Area (ID Area): Area a programmer can use for any purpose. Is
    ignored by the compiler.

Reserved Words: Words like READY, DATA, END, SET, FILE, IF, UNTIL, etc. are
    reserved by the compiler as they have syntactical meaning.
    
Structure: COBOL structure is as follows: DIVISIONS ─> SECTIONS ─> PARAGRAPHS ─┐
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    └─>SENTENCES ─> STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS: a single directive usually starting with a reserved word. STATEMENTS
    go into a SENTENCE.
    Example: ADD 2 TO TOTAL.
    Example: IF ITEM = "B"
                 ADD 2 TO TOTAL
             END-IF

PARAGRAPHS: Are user defined actions made up of smaller steps of SENTENCES. can
    be called like a function in multiple places in the code (e.g. applying
    interest, or reading user input).

SECTIONS: contains multiple PARAGRAPHS. Can have user-defined or pre-defined
    names.

DIVISIONS: Four COBOL DIVISIONS are:
    - IDENTIFICATION: where name, author, and documentation for the program goes
    - ENVIRONMENT: two SECTIONS: One sets environment to run the program, the
        other links the program to the files and data used
    - DATA: sets up all the data to be used 
    - PROCEDURE: instructions on how to take data in, display output, etc.

Variables: Names of variables are called "data names" can must be at most 30
    characters, cannot have whitespace, and cannot be a reserved word.
    Types: Numeric, Alphabetic, Alphanumeric
    PIC CLAUSE: The PICture CLAUSE, sets the length and datatype of programmer 
        selected variable (e.g. PIC 9 would be a numeric value of length 1)
        Example: PIC 9(4) - a numeric variable of 4 digits
        Example: PIC A - single alphabetic letter
        Example: PIC X(8) - 8 alphanumeric characters
        Example: PIC 9(4)V99 - 4 numeric digits, V=decimal place, 2 more digits
                (e.g. 1435.82)
        Example: PIC $9,999V99 - Can represent $1,203.48 
        Numeric maximum length is 18.
        Alphabetic maximum lenght is 255.

Literals: Used to set something once to be used the in rest of the program.
